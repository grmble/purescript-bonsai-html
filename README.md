# Purescript Bonsai HTML API

This is a Smolder-Style HTML API for Purescript Bonsai.
I could not use the excellent Smolder, because the Elm
VirtualDom has a phantom type on the emitted VNodes
and I wanted to retain that.

It's not an exact copy of Smolder, more of a reimplementation
with heavy guidance.  But the good bits are all ripped of from Smolder,
that's why I kept the LGPL.


`purescript-bonsai` is getting ready for 1.0.
Once released, this package will be documented at
https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-bonsai-jsdom/
